    <h2>The Tempest</h2>
    <h3>SCENE II. Another part of the island.</h3>
    <p >Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard</p>


    <h4>CALIBAN</h4>
    <p >All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on<br> Prosper fall and make him
        By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear<br> me And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
        Fright me with <br>urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,Nor lead.</p>
    <h4 >TRINCULO</h4>
    <p >Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any weather at all, and another<br> storm brewing;I hear
        it sing i' the wind: yond same blackcloud, yond huge<br> one, looks like a foul bombard that would
        shed his liquor.</p>
    <h4 >STEPHANO</h4>
    <P >I shall no more to sea, to sea,Here shall I die ashore,This is a very scurvy<br> tune to sing at a
        man's funeral:well, here's my comfort.</P>
    <h4 >CALIBAN</h4>
    <P >Do not torment me: Oh!</P>
    <h4>STEPHANO</h4>
    <P >What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put tricks upon's with<br> savages and men of Ind, ha? 
        I have not scaped drowning to be afeard now<br> of your four legs; for it hath been said, As proper
         a man as ever went on<br> four legs cannot make him give ground.</P>
    <h4>CALIBAN</h4>
    <P >The spirit torments me; Oh!</P>
    <h4 >STEPHANO</h4>
    <P >This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I take it,<br> an ague. Where the 
        devil should he learn our language? I will give him <br>some relief, if it be but for that.</P>
    <h4 >CALIBAN</h4>
    <P >Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.</P>
    <h4 >STEPHANO</h4>
    <p >He's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest.He shall taste of my bottle<br> if he have 
        never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his fit.If I can recover him<br> and keep him tame, I 
        will not take too much for him;he shall pay for him that hath<br> him, and that soundly.</p>
